**Metroscore**
===============

Metroscore is a Python package for analyzing transit quality in a region.
It compares the accessibility of driving to the accessibility of public transit options
(walking, biking, & public transit) for any given time, place, and trip length.
The result is a collection of analyses for a region that can be analyzed to understand how spatial and temporal
constraints affect transit performance.
